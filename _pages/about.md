I am a Master's student from the [School of Computer Information Engineering](https://jsjxy.jxnu.edu.cn/) at [Jiangxi Normal University](https://www.jxnu.edu.cn/main.htm), currently working on the design and application of constrained multi-objective evolutionary algorithms.

I am very fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Xinyu Zhou](https://jsjxy.jxnu.edu.cn/2019/0905/c3381a106190/page.htm) from the School of Computer Information Engineering at Jiangxi Normal University.
